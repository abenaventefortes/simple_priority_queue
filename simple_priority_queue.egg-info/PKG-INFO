# Simple Priority Queue

Simple Priority Queue is a Python library for managing a priority queue of tasks. It provides a priority queue data structure with the ability to add tasks with a defined priority, and process them in order of their priority. The library can be used through a Command Line Interface (CLI), a Graphical User Interface (GUI), or directly through its API.
